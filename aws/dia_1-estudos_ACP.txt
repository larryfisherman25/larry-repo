    = Global Infrastructure
    	- AWS is built around Regions and Availability Zones.
    	- Region (physical location) -> multiple Availability Zones
    	- Availability Zones -> one or more discrete data centers
    	- AWS operates in over 69 Availability Zones within over 22 regions around the world (2021)
    	- now it's 87 'A.zones' and 27 regions (2022)
    	- at least (minimum of 2 zones per region)
    	- He also have Edge locations -> used for caching content (CDN-content delivery network)
        * Edge Location > Availability Zones > Regions

    	- Choosing the AWS Region
    		* data storage laws
    		* latency to end users
    		* aws services

    	- Access to Services

                - the Beanstalk itself it's not paid, but the infra for deploying it's paid!
            * Cloud Formation (Management & Governance)
                - very similar to the Beanstalk, but not only for web applications
                - you can create an infrastructure from a template
            * OpsWorks (Management & Governance)
                - managed instances of Chef and puppet
