    = Global Infrastructure
    	- AWS is built around Regions and Availability Zones.
    	- Region (physical location) -> multiple Availability Zones
    	- Availability Zones -> one or more discrete data centers
    	- AWS operates in over 69 Availability Zones within over 22 regions around the world (2021)
    	- now it's 87 'A.zones' and 27 regions (2022)
    	- at least (minimum of 2 zones per region)
    	- He also have Edge locations -> used for caching content (CDN-content delivery network)
        * Edge Location > Availability Zones > Regions

    	- Choosing the AWS Region
    		* data storage laws
    		* latency to end users
    		* aws services

    	- Access to Services
    		* AWS Management Console
    		* Command Line Interface (CLI)
    		* Software Development kits (SDKs)

    	- Methods of Deploying and Operating in the AWS Cloud
    		* Elastic Beanstalk -> web applications (Compute)
    			- just upload the code, and it automatically deploy with the correct provisioning
                - the Beanstalk itself it's not paid, but the infra for deploying it's paid!
            * Cloud Formation (Management & Governance)
                - very similar to the Beanstalk, but not only for web applications
                - you can create an infrastructure from a template
            * OpsWorks (Management & Governance)
                - managed instances of Chef and puppet
                - configured, managed and deployed
            * CodeCommit (Developer Tools)
                - source control service (git)
                - Git-based repositories
            * CodeDeploy (Developer Tools)
                - automate deploy
                - EC2, Fargate, Lambda and on-premises
            * CodePipeline (Developer Tools)
                - continuous delivery
                - full Development pipeline, automating build, test and deploy
                - no upfront fee or long-term commitments, pays as you use
            * ECS - Elastic Container Service (Compute)
                - docker/container management and deploy
                - automatic infrastructure for your deployment
                - Fargate (manager)

    = EC2 - Elastic Computing Cloud
        - Fast, scalable and easy to start using
        - types of instances:
            * On-demand
                - pay-as-you-go model, where you don't need to provision your machine
                just start to using, and you pay as much as capabilities you demand
            * Reserved instances
                - you can save up to 75% provisioning a machine for your needs
                comparing to on-demand instances
            * Spot instances (usually additional)
                - 90% discount over an on-demand instance, e.g. gonna use an instance for a week
                it's better spot instance than others, save money.
            * Dedicated Host
                - physical server
                - fully-dedicated to your use
