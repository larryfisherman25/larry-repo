- Day 02 - Cloud Selfbootcamp -

üêß 1. Bash
How you will interact with servers.
In your Cloud account, deploy the cheapest Ubuntu VM possible.
Turn it off after you‚Äôre done but also configure it to turn off at a the end of the day in case you forget.

- Launching my first EC2 instance by myself
- Ubuntu VM
- Connecting to the EC2 instance via ssh
    - Created a keypair '.pem' and saved in my computer
    - I had trouble connecting. I was getting this message:

    @@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@
    @         WARNING: UNPROTECTED PRIVATE KEY FILE!          @
    @@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@

    - That's because my private key was with file permissions of 0777,
      which allow anyone to read or write to this file.
      This permission level is very insecure, and so SSH ignores this key.
    - So I had to change this file permission locally with the command:

                chmod 0400 .ssh/my_private_key.pem

    - And finally I could connect to the ubuntu VM with:

                ssh -v -i my_key.pem ec2-user@11.22.33.44

- Now I started to configure the LAMP stack on the VM:
    - Lists of the commands used:

        sudo apt-get update                         # update all packages outdated
        sudo apt install phpmyadmin                 # installing php
        sudo apt install mysql-server               # installing mysql
        sudo service mysql status                   # checking the status of mysql
        sudo ss -tap | grep mysql                   # once again checking mysql process
        ip address show                             # to grab ip address
        nano /etc/mysql/mysql.conf.d/mysqld.cnf     # changing the 'bind-address' of mysql-server
        sudo systemctl restart mysql.service        # restarting the mysql
        sudo apt-get install php libapache2-mod-php php-mysql   # installing php-mysql, problably dont have to do that again, idk.
        sudo systemctl restart apache2              # restarting the apache2

        # Configuring the mysql server
        mysql -u root -p
        CREATE DATABASE myapp;
        CREATE USER 'myappuser'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'password';
        GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON myapp.* TO 'myappuser'@'localhost';
        FLUSH PRIVILEGES;

        cd /var/www/html                    # went to this directory to check the files
        cat index.html                      # it has a template to test if everything its working

- Bash scripting
    - Creating simple update script
    - Create a sys-check script
    - Learn about how you can give a command calling a script without the './' in front of it.
        - You have to put into the $PATH variable
        - '~/.profile' has a if statement to find put a directory called 'bin' if it is in the home
        '~'
